# EleMatch
A match-3 game made entirely in JavaScript with a game engine called Phaser (Used <a href="https://www.phaser.io/phaser3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nolooper">Phaser 3</a>). I made this game in 6 days during the last two weeks at the coding bootcamp I attended, Flatiron School. It was a lot of fun to make and I intend on refining it further/adding to it.
## Usage
This app is hosted on <a href='https://elematch-game.firebaseapp.com' target="_blank" rel="noopener nolooper">Firebase</a> A demo for the app can be located <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4XU6rv774k' target="_blank" rel="noopener nolooper">here</a> <br><br>
If you want to run it locally, however, you just have to host a local server using the <code>index.html</code> file. I suggest using lite-server as it's simple to use. Just run <code>npm install -g lite-server</code> <br><br>
Once thats installed, navigate to the directory that holds the files then run <code>lite-server index.html</code>
## Requirements
This game only uses the <a href="https://www.phaser.io/phaser3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nolooper">Phaser 3</a> game engine for JavaScript which is included in the <code>game.html</code> file, so there are no packages one has to install if one wishes to run the program locally.
